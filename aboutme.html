		<h1>Hello</h1> 
		<h2>My name is Xavier D. McDaniel.</h2>
		<p> 
			Hello Everyone. My name is Xavier McDaniel. I am currently a resident of East 
			Cleveland, Ohio. I am 16 years old and am a participant of the College Credit Plus 
			(CCP) program.  My major is in Information Technology. As of now, I have received a 
			certificate in Mobile Application Development. I had the privilege of being in the Tri-C 
			spring commencement program this year. When I first started to take college courses at Tri-C, 
			I was 12 years old. Though I have some experience with HTML and CSS, I look forward to learn more 
			on JavaScript as well in this course. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
			I live with my 4 siblings, my parents, and our 3 turtles, Shadow, Shellie, and 
			Spike. I love to play the drums in our familyâ€™s band. We are performing at a wedding 
			this weekend in Columbus, Ohio for a friend of ours. Other interests I have are playing 
			video games on my PS3 and playing basketball. I hope to have a wonderful experience with 
			this course. I look forward to seeing what it has in store for me.
